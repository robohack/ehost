- util.c:canonical() should not use geth_byname() but should use
  get_info(T_A) so as to avoid accidentally seeing YP or /etc/hosts
  entries that would not actually be valid.  Note that fixing this
  involves makeing sure callers and users of the return status that
  get_info() stores in h_errno don't accidentally assume it's a valid
  input to h_strerror().  This will fix the problem with /etc/hosts
  entries causing fake "not canonical" errors when the wrong hostname
  appears in h_hname.

- implement host_h_strerror() to return descriptions for extended error
  codes from get_info() -- or maybe don't over-load h_errno in
  get_hinfo() but instead also implement global host_errno?

- do not use gethostbyname()/gethostbyaddr() or their newer replacements
  to do basic A and PTR lookups and checks, but instead use the
  low-level interfaces.  Provide separate options for using those
  functions just so that the native implementations can be tested.

- check that the names in the answer records match the names we asked
  for (taking CNAMEs into account where they're allowed).

- allow for setting the (stream) read timeout (conn_timeout) at runtime.

- use setservbyname() to get the local NAMESERVER_PORT value.

- allow runtime specification of destination port in server with ':PORT'

- allow runtime specification of source port with '-O'

- clean up the host_res_*() mess.

- try to build a regression test suite (but how do we feed it known
  bogus junk to test error handling?  nc?).

- think about using autobuild.
