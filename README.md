# (e)Host

An enhanced version of the venerable `host` utility for performing DNS
lookups, testing DNS consistency, and gathering DNS zone statistics.


### Rest In Peace Eric Wassenaar.

Eric Wassenaar was killed in a traffic accident on April 10th of 2000.
He was the original author of `vrfy`, as well as the maintainer of
several other programs that were commonly known as the NIKHEF-NL network
tools, after the National Institute for Nuclear Physics and High Energy
Physics in Amsterdam where he worked and was responsible for their
network operations and their connection to the Internet.  His original
web page at www.nikhef.nl/user/e07, and the FTP archive of his tools at
ftp.nikhef.nl, was removed shortly after his death.

There is however a mirror of Eric's NIKHEF FTP tools directory available
here:  http://www.dfred.net/public/src/nikhef_nettools/

See the tribute to him in the [NIKHEF 2000 Annual
report](https://www.nikhef.nl/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Annual_Report-2000.pdf
"NIKHEF 2000 Annual report").

I have maintained Eric's versions of `host`, `ping`, and `vrfy` since
then.
